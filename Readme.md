# Fuel cell system
Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) are the most promising fuel cell technology because of their high-power density, low operating temperature, quick startup capability, and low weight. Efficient use of the PEMFC requires keeping it working at an adequate power point and protecting fuel cells from damage problems. Through this project, we learn how to extract the maximum power from the PEMFC system and protect it from membrane damage by stabilizing the hydrogen and oxygen partial pressure.

This project focuses on studying Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) control for fuel cell systems, an area of significant interest in renewable energy research. Fuel cells offer a promising clean energy source, capable of converting chemical energy directly into electricity with high efficiency and minimal emissions. However, efficiently harnessing this power output, which fluctuates based on operating conditions, is a challenging task. MPPT techniques aim to optimize the power extraction from fuel cells by continuously adjusting system parameters to match varying conditions. By implementing and analyzing MPPT control, this study seeks to enhance the performance and reliability of fuel cell systems, contributing to the development of sustainable energy solutions.
## Reinforcement Learning control 
This project investigates the application of ``Q-learning``, a model-free reinforcement learning technique, for Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) control in fuel cell systems. The goal of MPPT is to optimize the fuel cell's power output under varying conditions, such as fluctuating load demands and environmental factors. Traditional MPPT methods often rely on predefined models or deterministic algorithms, which may not adapt well to the dynamic and nonlinear characteristics of fuel cells. Q-learning, however, offers a robust alternative by enabling an agent to learn optimal control policies through trial and error, adjusting continuously to maximize power output efficiently without requiring an accurate model of the system. This approach aims to enhance the responsiveness and efficiency of MPPT in fuel cell systems, contributing to their viability as a sustainable energy source.
